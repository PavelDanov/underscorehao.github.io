      <description>Introduction There are millions of consultancies out there and more are popping left and right by the minute. Some are outsource shops or a couple of dev friends teaming up in trying to create a business, others are big multinational corporations that bid on big government or enterprise contracts.

      <description>In this series I will share some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned throughout my software development career. A few of them might be targeted to people that are not in the industry, but want, or are about to get into it. Others will be useful to more experienced people with a position or two (or more) under the belt.
It should be noted that everything described here is derived from my own experiences.</description>
