      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series I will share some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned throughout my software development career. A few of them might be targeted to people that are not in the industry, but want, or are about to get into it. Others will be useful to more experienced people with a position or two (or more) under the belt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that everything described here is derived from my own experiences. You&amp;rsquo;re free to disagree with any point. There are short &lt;code&gt;TL; DR&lt;/code&gt; versions to all posts if you don&amp;rsquo;t care much for my actual reasoning. Whether you want to read through everything or not, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that up to you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
