<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hey there, I&rsquo;m Pavel Danov. Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find about things that interest me and occupy my attention most of the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m originally from <code>Bulgaria</code> but moved to <code>London</code> in 2018.</p>
<p>My interests are too broad to list, but some honorable mentions - martial arts (been practicing for more than 20 years), film, reading books (a lot of history, politics and science).</p>
<p>Most people that know me are aware of my love for languages, having studied to varying degrees of success - English, German, Russian and now learning Chinese. 我认识你很高兴！</p>
<h2 id="software-engineer">Software Engineer</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been occupied in the software industry professionally for more than a decade and I&rsquo;ve been enamored with computers since I was a child.</p>
<p>I like to play games and I am also fond of bashing my head against the wall when trying to make them. I&rsquo;m the founder of a small game development studio and have a couple of projects in the pipeline including creating my own game engine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m available on a contract basis for consulting, development or tutoring.</p>
