    <h1>Back to University</h1>

    

    <p>I haven&rsquo;t written here for quite a while. Writing again feels like a way to mark this new beginning, to chronicle what it’s like returning to a structured path after so many years. In my time of absence, I began countless drafts, but none felt quite right to publish. The past few years have been a storm of global crises, career shifts, and personal battles that left me questoning my direction. I switched jobs twice, only to leave them both and go towards the contracting route. It was a time of intense internal work, a sort of 内功 (nèigōng), or <em>&lsquo;internal skill/strength&rsquo;</em> as it&rsquo;s called in Chinese martial arts.</p>
<p>Life in my late 20s felt like one step forward, two steps back. I’d thought I had things figured out, only to learn that moving to a new country didn’t solve the problems I hoped it would. If anything, it introduced new challenges, and soon I felt stuck again. Yet slowly, as I began working through this inner turmoil, I started to find my footing again.</p>
<p>One of the toughest questions I faced was around career satisfaction. I often wondered if I’d taken the wrong path entirely. I love programming, but finding paid work that also matched my interests felt impossible. When people rely on your income, you tend to choose the highest-paying offer, not necessarily the most interesting. I filled the rest of my free time learning new programming languages, frameworks, and topics that piqued my interest, but I couldn’t stick with any of them for long. The graveyard of started, but never finished projects grew. I was trying to fill my time without a concrete goal in place. The existential dread pulled me down with every step, and I longed to regain the balance I once knew. To use another traditional martial arts term I was trying to 内外合一 (nèiwài hé yī) - unite the internal and the external.</p>
<p>That combined with the fact that we live in a world where it’s easy to numb ourselves with constant online distraction, and I found myself questioning if the problem was my environment or me. Was I just lazy? Should I give up and settle into the corporate routine, as uninspired as it felt?</p>
<p>Ultimately I turned 30, and I realized it was neither. I simply needed a fresh challenge and a bit more structure. Which brings me to the headline of this post.</p>
<p>Math and physics have always fascinated me, though my relationship with these subjects soured due to lackluster teaching and lack of guidance in my formative school years. I&rsquo;ve felt drawn to them, but afraid.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming from an early age, and I started working straight away during my final year of high school. That kind of enforced my view. Programming seemed like a safe haven that didn’t <em>&lsquo;require&rsquo;</em> math, so I leaned into it. But as the years passed, I felt an itch to revisit these disciplines. I tried self-study a few times, but progress felt slow and sporadic.</p>
<p>Late last year, after another period of deep reflection, I came to a clear decision: I wanted to go back to university to pursue a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics and Physics. I reached out to a friend in Bulgaria to send me some old textbooks, gathered resources recommended by others, and began a more serious self-study routine. Progress was slow, but it was there, and each small step brought me closer to feeling ready.</p>
<p>And now, it’s official — I’ve enrolled in university and will begin classes on February 1st, 2025. I’m excited to dive back into learning with a fresh perspective and renewed discipline! This post marks the beginning of that journey, and I hope to share each step, challenge, and perhaps even some insights along the way!</p>
