      <description>Introduction There are millions of consultancies out there and more are popping left and right by the minute. Some are outsource shops or a couple of dev friends teaming up in trying to create a business, others are big multinational corporations that bid on big government or enterprise contracts. There&amp;rsquo;s a consultancy for virtually every business domain you can think of and everything in-between. They like to advertise themselves as providing digital transformation, being cloud native, engineering intuition (facepalm) and a litany of other meaningless slogans.</description>

      <description>Why? The usefulness of this approach is debatable, but let me try to offer an answer on why you might want to know how to do that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s the mark of a good engineer to know what&amp;rsquo;s happening under the hood. Simple as that. New or inexperienced developers will benefit from understanding the connection between the user interface in Visual Studio and the actual command line tools used underneath.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello dear visitor!
Before you stands a very long article in which you&amp;rsquo;ll find my review and results after spending 31 days with a book called Remembering Simplified Hanzi 1: How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Chinese Characters written by James Heisig and Timothy W. Richardson. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a groundbreaking book and an amazing method because it broke down a certain wall that was hindering my desire and drive to learn the Chinese language for a long time.</description>

Filtered topic - this means you have only one topic for all of your event types. All publishers push messages onto that single topic. Some of the message fields and properties are then used for filtering by the subscribers since in most cases a subscriber will be interested only in certain types of messages.</description>

      <description>Caching is hard On a bright sunny day while you&amp;rsquo;re working on your awesome project you catch a glimpse of something. You bring yourself closer to the monitor and begin meticulously examining your code. What you find brings you feelings of disgust and shame!

      <description>The Problem Today I faced a problem which I knew would come, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to implement properly at the time. There were more urgent tasks at hand before, deadlines to be met and this issue remained unresolved.
