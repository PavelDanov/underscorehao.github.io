Here I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding books I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading and have read during the year. Usually I read more than one book at the same time. I make a distinction between recreational reading and doing so as part of something I&amp;rsquo;m currently studying. If I&amp;rsquo;m studying from a book I also take notes, pay extra attention etc.
Currently Reading    Name Author(s)     C++ Primer (5th Edition) Stanley B.</description>

      <description>The Pursuit Last couple of months have been interesting on a multitude of levels. Global pandemic and economic doom notwithstanding, the pandemic has been a net positive for me on a professional and financial level.
Working from home for the past 5 months has given me a lot of time to reflect and do some planning around the things I want to learn and, by extension achieve in the near future.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello dear visitor!
Before you stands a very long article in which you&amp;rsquo;ll find my review and results after spending 31 days with a book called Remembering Simplified Hanzi 1: How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Chinese Characters written by James Heisig and Timothy W. Richardson. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a groundbreaking book and an amazing method because it broke down a certain wall that was hindering my desire and drive to learn the Chinese language for a long time.</description>

 Filtered topic - this means you have only one topic for all of your event types. All publishers push messages onto that single topic. Some of the message fields and properties are then used for filtering by the subscribers since in most cases a subscriber will be interested only in certain types of messages.</description>

      <description>Caching is hard On a bright sunny day while you&amp;rsquo;re working on your awesome project you catch a glimpse of something. You bring yourself closer to the monitor and begin meticulously examining your code. What you find brings you feelings of disgust and shame! You&amp;rsquo;ve been calling an API retrieving data you need over and over again even though said data hardly changes!

      <description>The Problem Today I faced a problem which I knew would come, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to implement properly at the time. There were more urgent tasks at hand before, deadlines to be met and this issue remained unresolved.
