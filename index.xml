      <description>At the start of 2022 I decided to start journaling. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried both digital and physical approaches in the past, but neither stuck. It might&amp;rsquo;ve been due to my mindset at the time, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found the best option for me now is an actual physical notebook. Total shocker I know - using dead trees for my own nefarious purposes. Might be a relic of my school days, but my thought flows better on paper despite 20 years of constant PC use.</description>

      <title>Compiling C&#43;&#43; project using SFML with cl.exe</title>

      <description>Why? The usefulness of this approach is debatable, but let me try to offer an answer on why you might want to know how to do that. I think it&amp;rsquo;s the mark of a good engineer to know what&amp;rsquo;s happening under the hood. Simple as that. New or inexperienced developers will benefit from understanding the connection between the user interface in Visual Studio and the actual command line tools used underneath.</description>

      <title>In the Pursuit of Knowledge and Mastery</title>

      <description>The Pursuit Last year has been interesting on a multitude of levels. Global pandemic and economic doom notwithstanding, COVID has been a net positive for me on a professional and financial level.
With that said earlier this year while in lockdown I arrived at the conclusion that I have more or less plateaued as far as my skills and knowledge are concerned. It&amp;rsquo;s not something I like to admit, but after asking myself questions around what I&amp;rsquo;ve actually learned I wasn&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with the answers.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello dear visitor!
Before you stands a very long article in which you&amp;rsquo;ll find my review and results after spending 31 days with a book called Remembering Simplified Hanzi 1: How Not to Forget the Meaning and Writing of Chinese Characters written by James Heisig and Timothy W. Richardson. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a groundbreaking book and an amazing method because it broke down a certain wall that was hindering my desire and drive to learn the Chinese language for a long time.</description>

      <description>Multiple topics There are two main approaches when it comes to topics in Azure Service Bus. Depending what&amp;rsquo;s your architecture and needs you can have either:
 Filtered topic - this means you have only one topic for all of your event types. All publishers push messages onto that single topic. Some of the message fields and properties are then used for filtering by the subscribers since in most cases a subscriber will be interested only in certain types of messages.</description>

      <description>Caching is hard On a bright sunny day while you&amp;rsquo;re working on your awesome project you catch a glimpse of something. You bring yourself closer to the monitor and begin meticulously examining your code. What you find brings you feelings of disgust and shame! You&amp;rsquo;ve been calling an API retrieving data you need over and over again even though said data hardly changes!
Being the smart and responsible engineer that you are, you decide to rectify your mistake immediately.</description>

      <title>.NET Core API with DynamoDB Context Dependency Injection</title>

      <description>The Problem Today I faced a problem which I knew would come, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to implement properly at the time. There were more urgent tasks at hand before, deadlines to be met and this issue remained unresolved.
Amazon&amp;rsquo;s .NET Core SDK is very good for the most part. Everything works as it should. But let&amp;rsquo;s say you use the .NET Object Persistence Model for DynamoDB in your service and you have mapped C# classes to DynamoDB tables like this:</description>
