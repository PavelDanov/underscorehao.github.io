</h2>
<p>Last year has been interesting on a multitude of levels. Global pandemic and economic doom notwithstanding, COVID has been a net positive for me on a professional and financial level.</p>
<p>With that said earlier this year while in lockdown I arrived at the conclusion that I have more or less plateaued as far as my skills and knowledge are concerned. It&rsquo;s not something I like to admit, but after asking myself questions around what I&rsquo;ve actually learned I wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with the answers. It just wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Working from home for the past 18 months has given me a lot of free time that I didn&rsquo;t have before. With that free time came the mental space to reflect on my situation. The hidden caveat of that being also a lot more time for unwanted habits and distractions came to the forefront.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gained knowledge in new areas I had to do for work in the past year, but those were few and far between. I haven&rsquo;t made any serious strides in improving my understanding on the engineering topics that really interest me for example. My pursuit is toward more deeper knowledge and eventual mastery of a subject, not just trivia or surface level understanding that can pose as serious comprehension.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also neglected my own personal business aspirations which is actively hurting me financially since operating a business (with zero revenue I might add) incurs costs.</p>
<p>The first step to improve is to realize there&rsquo;s a problem. I worked remotely from Bulgaria (where I&rsquo;m from) for 6 weeks this August and September while slowly and subconsciously a plan started to form in my head. Plan around the things I want to learn and by extension achieve in the (hopefully) near future. I&rsquo;m not really talking about setting goals, rather putting a robust process of learning and action in place.</p>
<p>To that end I&rsquo;ve devised a routine on how I&rsquo;d like to proceed so I can improve in the areas that I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>My current routine (most days since I&rsquo;m back to London) is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wake up at 5:30 every day</li>
<li>Meditation for 10-15 mins</li>
<li>Exercise between 45-60 mins (Martial Arts, HIIT, Calisthenics)</li>
<li>Quick cold shower</li>
<li>Small breakfast while reading something</li>
<li><strong>Morning Deep Work Slot for 2-2.5 hours</strong></li>
<li>Morning core working hours for my job between 9:00-12:00
<ul>
<li>Bursts of focused work when working on a task/researching something</li>
<li>Stand-up and walk/stretch/punch/kick around my room often when not doing focused work, also I have a wooden dummy :)</li>
<li>Go out/make/order something for quick lunch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Noon Deep Work Slot for 45-60 mins</strong></li>
<li>Afternoon core working hours for my job between 13:00-17:30
<ul>
<li>Same thing as the morning: bursts of focused work</li>
<li>Same thing as the morning: standing-up, stretching etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>30-45 minute break after work</li>
<li><strong>Evening Deep Work Slot for 1.5-2 hours</strong></li>
<li>Free time
<ul>
<li>Dinner</li>
<li>Play games</li>
<li>Watch movies/TV shows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going to bed at around 21:45
<ul>
<li>Try to not use phone, PC or iPad at least 30 minutes before going to bed.</li>
<li>Reading from my Kindle is allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a 100% rigid routine, but I try to follow it as much as I can every day. The <strong>Deep Work</strong> slots are the bits where I do most of my learning/practice now. I&rsquo;ve used that same approach initially when I did my <a href="https://underscorehao.net/2020/05/learning-1500-chinese-characters-in-a-month-heisig-method-review/">Chinese character learning experiment</a>. Most days (so far) I hit all 3 slots, but some days I imagine it&rsquo;s going to be 2 or even only 1 when unforeseen things get thrown my way eventually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing is to be aware that life happens and you&rsquo;re not a robot!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point is to come back, come back and strive to achieve the routine. The goal is to set the process of improving continuously. If I fail some days I won&rsquo;t beat myself up too much and try to do better tomorrow. This is something called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/">the X effect</a> and I like it a lot.</p>
<p>Weekends are freeroll. I do whatever I want. I still do some work, but I try to relax and recharge.</p>

  The Knowledge
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-knowledge">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>What am I doing in my <strong>Deep Work</strong> time is another interesting matter. I focus on only one field/area in each slot which means that each of them is specific to what I want to improve. Trying to focus on multiple things in one sitting like solving math problems and studying Chinese obviously defeats the purpose of calling it <strong>Deep Work</strong>. Some days I chain all times to a single knowledge area and others I do 3 separate things throughout the day. It depends entirely on what I want to learn and achieve. I see benefits in both approaches so I try to mix them.</p>
<p>Some of the topics I&rsquo;m going through right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematics</strong> - I&rsquo;ve been going through the full suite of Khan Academy Math lessons (yes, from the 1st grade). I have gaps in my Math knowledge which were bestowed upon me by a series of horrible Math teachers. Twelve years at school and not one good Math teacher. I really drew the short straw on that one and now ten years later I&rsquo;m paying the price. My desire to improve my engineering knowledge and understanding is directly tied to improving my math. I&rsquo;m watching every lesson, solving equations and doing the tests. I&rsquo;m trying to be as practical as I can.</li>
<li><strong>C#/CLR</strong> - Trying to gain deeper understanding on what makes C# and the CLR tick. As of right now just going through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft&rsquo;s documentation</a> making notes and looking at code.</li>
<li><strong>Low-level programming concepts/hardware</strong> - This is a bit generic I know, but I want to gain deeper understanding on how computers work. Some of the books I&rsquo;m going through right now are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83895.Computer_Organization_Design">Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface</a> by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy</li>
<li><a href="http://programminggroundup.blogspot.com/2007/01/programming-from-ground-up.html">Programming from the Ground Up: An Introduction to Programming using Linux Assembly Language</a> by Jonathan Bartlett</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> by Charles Petzold (read it many times, but it&rsquo;s so good so I&rsquo;m going through it again)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>C++</strong> - I haven&rsquo;t worked professionally with C++ for almost 5 years and want to go back into it. Main resources I&rsquo;m using are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">learncpp.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">C++ reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/768080.C_Primer">C++ Primer</a> by Stanley B. Lippman, JosÃ©e Lajoie and Barbara E. Moo</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also dived in <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/learn.php">SFML</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Studying Chinese</strong> - The only non-technical skill that has a <strong>Deep Work</strong> slot now. After I finished my <a href="https://underscorehao.net/2020/05/learning-1500-chinese-characters-in-a-month-heisig-method-review/">experiment</a> I started listening/reading study. The Heisig method did wonders for my character knowledge so now I&rsquo;m trying to learn vocabulary with the characters I learned and try to speak and form sentences. For listening/speaking practice I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX60lVXkfYly8">Learn Chinese</a> playlist. I have started the second volume of Heisig albeit with a slower pace than what I&rsquo;ve done in the <a href="https://underscorehao.net/2020/05/learning-1500-chinese-characters-in-a-month-heisig-method-review/">past</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Vim</strong> - I&rsquo;m trying to learn and use Vim.
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been using <code>vimtutor</code> daily. Serves quite nicely for muscle memory training which I can appreciate with my MA background.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18632407-vim-and-vi-tips">Vim and Vi Tips: Essential Vim and Vi Editor Skills</a> - Got this book for free years ago on my Kindle (don&rsquo;t remeber how or where), but so far it&rsquo;s good enough for me as a beginner</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mastery">
  Mastery
  <a class="heading-link" href="#mastery">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t set a timeframe on finishing any of those topics anytime soon. Each of them is a lifetime pursuit for a lot of people. Like I said I&rsquo;m trying to set a process of constant small daily improvements.</p>
<p>My overreaching goal when engineering is concerned now is to gain enough understanding in all of the aforementioned fields. At some point I&rsquo;d like to dive more into things like physics and graphics programming both of which are of great interest to me.</p>
<p>I hope to attain mastery (whatever that means in this context) but until then I have to take it one day at a time, one deep work slot at a time. As <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/91976/on-developing-deep-programming-knowledge/91998#91998">Maglob</a> has smartly said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to learn something, read about it; if you want to understand something, write about it; if you want to master something, program it.&rdquo;</p>
