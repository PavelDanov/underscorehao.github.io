<p>At the start of 2022 I decided to start journaling. I&rsquo;ve tried both digital and physical approaches in the past, but neither stuck. It might&rsquo;ve been due to my mindset at the time, but I&rsquo;ve found the best option for me <strong><em>now</em></strong> is an actual physical notebook. Total shocker I know - using dead trees for my own nefarious purposes. Might be a relic of my school days, but my thought flows better on paper despite 20 years of constant PC use.</p>
<p>In any case it has become a small ritual that I do at the end of every day just before going to bed. A couple of sentences and it&rsquo;s lights out.</p>
<p>With that said I have no intention of making those notes public, however a public retrospect on a quarterly basis might be fine in a digital format. So I&rsquo;m giving this a try and we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write mainly about my approach to trying to do and plan for things. I&rsquo;ve made some changes to my internal processes since last year and I think that&rsquo;s what might be valuable for other people. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>The way I plan and do things can be categorized in a couple of ways which people might find interesting and/or beneficial. I&rsquo;m not perfect and as I&rsquo;ve stated <a href="https://underscorehao.net/2021/09/in-the-pursuit-of-knowledge-and-mastery/">before</a> people are not robots. I try to adhere to the plan and habits I have, but life happens and adjustment is needed when obstacles block your path.</p>
<p>At the start of a month I try and formulate a big picture view for it, then I try to set achievable goals or plan for certain processes I&rsquo;d like to develop in my life. Those things can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>New habits I&rsquo;d like to adopt</li>
<li>Skills I&rsquo;d like to learn</li>
<li>Things that I want to avoid</li>
<li>Concrete things I&rsquo;d like to do e.g. finish reading book(s) X etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>When that is done I do the same for the first week of the month. Sunday night I assess the week&rsquo;s info (wins and things that haven&rsquo;t gone as good as they should&rsquo;ve) and prepare the batch of stuff for next week. All of this takes less than an hour in total and by now it&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<h2 id="daily-process">Daily process</h2>
<p>My daily process is rather simple. Aside from my daily habits which I try to do every day, what I&rsquo;ve found that works for me is a block of time/unit of work that is <strong>5 minutes</strong>. This means that if I want to work on something, 5 minutes is the lowest amount of time I&rsquo;ll spend on it. If I don&rsquo;t stop at the 5 minute mark I&rsquo;ll do 10, if I don&rsquo;t stop at 15, I&rsquo;ll do 20 and so on in increments of 5.</p>
<p>So for example usually I do exercise sessions of 30 minutes 3-4 times a day:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the morning</li>
<li>Lunch time</li>
<li>Evening</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as people that train martial arts even semi-seriously know, when you get an insight or an idea and you want to try out something, better try it straight away even for a little bit.</p>
<p>The 5 minute chunks translate well into pomodoros as well. I&rsquo;ve broken down my work day into 2 big pomodoro cycles. Each cycle is then broken down into 4x45 minute pomodoros which is 180 minutes or 3 hours of actual deep work. I have set 10 minutes break between each pomodoro, but sometimes the break is skipped and I go straight for the next 45 minutes. After a big cycle I have a longer break which is usually at lunchtime when I do an exercise session, have some food etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The relationship between discipline and willpower is an interesting one. For long I thought I don&rsquo;t have willpower, but with time I found out that willpower is overrated and discipline is more useful. Granted, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found that works for me. For others it might be different. I try to form (some) habits of things that I don&rsquo;t necessarily like to do, but I recognize that I <strong>need</strong> to do when it comes to achieving some overreaching or important milestone. There are millions of books on the subject, but the answer always lies within - <strong><em>nosce te ipsum</em></strong>. You have to do the actual work in the end even if you don&rsquo;t like it. I think that&rsquo;s small price to pay in the present for potential big gain in the future.</p>
